Hey user! input the values for an adjacency matrix with the size of 4.
You can input the values in any format you want, only the digits will be read. 
Don't forget! The digits need to be 1 or 0.

| 0 0 0 0 |
| 0 0 0 0 |
| 0 0 0 0 |
| 0 0 0 0 |

Hey user! now input 2 values from the tree, and the program will check if the first one is a root for the second. 
Enter u (the root): 
Enter v (the node): 
Nicely done! u = 0, v = 1
The output is: 0

Hello again user! For this final part of the assignment, the program will do the same thing as before, but infinitely!
That means the program will scan for u and v, until you input (-1,-1) or EOF.
Enter u (the root): 
Enter v (the node): 
Nicely done! u = 0, v = 0
The output is: 0

Enter u (the root): 
Enter v (the node): 


Goodbye!
